I am honestly apprehensive to do so, however, because you have left several tells in your message that indicate you\u2019re not entirely grounded in reality despite what you think. You are conspiratorial (bringing up Hunter Biden and ignoring the fact that he was convicted\u2014just not punished enough to your liking, I suppose\u2014while also failing to mention Trump\u2019s legal woes of which, if any normal citizen were guilty of, they\u2019d have been locked up in prison a long time ago. But I bet you believe that\u2019s a witch hunt and weaponization of government or \u201clawfare,\u201d whatever the right wing talking heads are calling it today. Further, the fact that you claim justthenews.com is a trustworthy source of information is jaw-dropping considering they make it readily apparent that they have a strong right wing bias (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/just-the-news/), but you\u2019ll probably call that fake news and continue to eat it up.\n\nAlso, my success has nothing to do with your imaginary friend(s). I worked my ass off and got to where I am through sacrifice and intelligence. If god is responsible for my success, he\u2019s equally as responsible for all the bad that happens too since he\u2019s all powerful and omnipotent. Do you thank god for the hurricanes that swept through the south recently? It\u2019s literally a natural occurrence, sometimes referred to as an \u201cact of god.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re struggling so hard. I wish your prayers would actually be met with blessings instead of hardship (maybe try praying harder? I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s not working). I\u2019ll accept your personal experience of struggling as a part of the middle class, but I won\u2019t accept you speaking for \u201cother middle class people.\u201d Unless they\u2019re sending you bank statements and itemized lists of their monthly expenses, you have no idea how they\u2019re truly doing. Financial literacy is not equal among all people and there are plenty of people who make irresponsible choices with their money regardless of how much they make. I have to laugh when people are complaining about not being able to afford the price of eggs while they\u2019re decked out in their Trump shirt, gold Trump shoes, red MAGA hat, a Trump bible in one hand and a Trump flag in the other, only to then immediately pivot to how this Trump rally in Pennsylvania is the 35th one they\u2019ve attended thus far despite living in Florida.\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on the boat parades. If you own a boat and you use it, there is no room for complaining about money. I own a boat. I use my boat. I recognize that my boat is a luxury purchase and so are all those center console boats I see on the news flying Trump flags (and sometimes Nazi flags too, it seems). But again, these are the same people whining about how the middle class is being destroyed at the pump and grocery store. The cognitive dissonance is palpable.\n\nComparing gas prices today to 10 years ago is a display of sheer ignorance. Why stop there? Why isn\u2019t gas .95 cents a gallon like it was in 1990?!? This country is going to hell in a handbasket (/s)! And I\u2019m not even going to go into the fact that The United States produced more crude oil than any nation at any time, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s International Energy Statistics, for the past six years in a row. So Trump\u2019s plan to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d just means more of what is already happening, yet he thinks it will be some kind of an economic windfall when HE does it. It\u2019s almost as if there are external factors that move the price of gas. Factors controlled by individual sovereign countries and economic organizations like OPEC. I only brought up the price of gas being reasonable as a preemptive argument because people love to harp on it as if the United States Presidential Administration unilaterally sets the price (see those childish \u201cI did that!\u201d stickers that were showing up on pumps). If gas is too expensive, buy a fuel efficient car. Again, the same people crying about these prices are doing it through the window of a lifted Ford F-250 Super Duty while towing their aforementioned boats.\n\nYes, some people are genuinely struggling, I\u2019m not discounting that. There are plans for that, though helping those who struggle is decried by the right as \u201csocialist, communist, AND fascist\u201d as if they can be all three at once.\n\nLastly, if you don\u2019t think Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, you\u2019re not paying close enough attention. He talks about arresting dissidents and political opponents (for no reason\u2026 not for legitimate things like taking and willfully withholding classified documents, trying to illegally influence an election, inciting an insurrection, etc.) We are indeed a democratic country (yes, a \u201cconstitutional republic,\u201d but a democratic one nonetheless) and for that to work requires trust and faith in our government institutions. Trump has destroyed so much through his constant lies about whatever and whoever isn\u2019t loyal to him that half our country subscribes to conspiratorial nonsense. They eat it up without any evidence and have developed the ability to dismiss obvious truths. His rhetoric has absolutely torn the fabric of democracy to the point where there are far too many people that believe our voting system lacks integrity when it is demonstrably one of the most secure in the world. Him and his ilk never ONCE provided evidence to back up their claims\u2026 ever. I encourage you to read the 1,889 pages of evidence and testimony that was unsealed today and read for yourself what people in his very own camp and political party had to say about his failed attempt to stay in office. But you won\u2019t, I know.\n\nAnyway, I know this was all a huge waste of time because you\u2019ll just write it all off and you\u2019ll keep consuming the lies you\u2019ve come to love. Go ahead, be the side that cheers on the death of democracy. The truth is you are the minority (about 30% of eligible voters). If it weren\u2019t for the Electoral College, that cancerous party would be a relic of the past a long time ago.\n\nBy the way, this is all coming from a former registered Republican who voted for Trump in 2016 and left the party just after January 6th. Those people don\u2019t represent me even a little and I\u2019m willing to bet that they won\u2019t represent you the way you think they will. You are not the chosen one that won\u2019t be chewed up and spit out just like many others who hitched their wagons to Trump and are now criticized as being the worst of the worst despite once being part of what he himself claims were \u201cthe best people.\u201d\n\nWake up!

She immediately felt compelled to share the audio in her own video, with the superimposed text, \u201cFathers are voting for this man.\u201d The video has been viewed 2.5 million times and was reshared by singer Billie Eilish to her 68 million followers.\n\n> Brigid Quinn, a 15-year-old in Georgia, knew that Trump had been accused of making sexist comments, she said.

Some people came up to her at school saying her TikTok was the first they had ever heard of the tape.\n\n> This election season, Trump\u2019s and Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s campaigns have run sprawling operations on TikTok, both posting to their own accounts and paying influencers to reach the video app\u2019s large share of Gen Z and millennial users. Notably, TikTok is the only platform that confirmed to The Post that users can use the word \u201cvote\u201d in their videos without being suppressed. But neither candidate can control the narrative on the app\u2019s algorithmic feed, where videos shoot to viral fame regardless of whether they\u2019re tied to the current news cycle.\n\n> The infamous tape came about a month before the 2016 presidential election and set off a crisis within the Republican Party, which was already grappling with Trump\u2019s insurgent campaign. Trump apologized for his comments in the video but also sought to downplay them as \u201clocker room banter.\u201d\n\n> A number of prominent Republicans announced they were no longer supporting Trump, and some even called on him to end his candidacy. The Republican speaker of the House at the time, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said he was \u201csickened\u201d by the tape and told colleagues he would no longer defend Trump.\n\n> Now, Trump is running for president with the backing of the Republican Party. But in the internet era, content never dies. Some social media users must carefully manage their so-called digital footprints to avoid blowback from colleges, jobs or their social circles. The same goes for public figures. In July, for example, the personal blog that vice-presidential nominee JD Vance kept during college made the rounds on X.\n\n> News cycles on social media often take their cues from evocative posts and videos, rather than the mainstream media.\n\n> \u201cThanks to social apps, things that weren\u2019t necessarily relevant for one election cycle may come back to haunt in subsequent election cycles,\u201d said Jeffrey Blevins, a professor of journalism and political science at University of Cincinnati.\n\n> Some of the trending \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d TikToks came from older users who heard Trump\u2019s comments the first time around.
